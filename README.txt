My Contributions are as follows
All des_input.c
Half of des.h
Half of des_controller.h
Half of State Diagram


## Status
The assignment is complete, all requirements are met. Processes are killed approprietely and expected messages are
printing to the screen. No Crashes
 
## Known Issues
For some reason i i have difficulty using the state and direction stored in the person obj, bascially what happens is, the modified 
value of the sate and direction in the person obj from the controller is lost. So with each new iteraction of the while loop, the initial object
returns. To remedy this I created global variables to replace them in the controller. Unfortanate that I was unable
to resolve this.


## Expected Grade
I'm expecting full marks because it functions as expected. I'm hoping global variables for state and direction
will not impact my grade.

Thank you,
